Download the Sprinbaord package (which includes Drupal core and all the required modules).

INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure you have followed all the preparation steps, before installing Drupal.
If all your files are uploaded and in the right place, it's time to install Drupal.

Proceed with installation as you normally would. When asked for an installation 
profile, choose 'Springboard'.

Please consult the handbooks (http://drupal.org/handbooks) if you need help installing Drupal.


CUSTOMIZATION AND POST-INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hopefully everything went smoothly and the install profile is running out of the box.
Most likely you will have to go and configure various settings before launching your site.

The most important configuration options are the access rules for anonymous users. If
you don't want anonymous users to be able to edit pages, go to

'administer > users > access control'
