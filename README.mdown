The Springboard install profile makes it easy to get started with a fundraising website.

For full installation instructions, see the [GoSpringboard.com documentation](http://www.gospringboard.com/documentation/installing-springboard).

Note for GitHub users
---------------------
If you checkout or download this install profile from GitHub directly, be aware that this is not a complete package: this project contains only the install profile definition and `make` file that lists the required modules. There are two other projects that complete the puzzle:

* [springboard_modules](https://github.com/JacksonRiver/springboard_modules): Contains only the modules that are specific to Springboard. These can be dropped into an existing Drupal site to add Springboard functionality to it.
* [Springboard-Build](https://github.com/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build): A `drush make` file that will download and assemble the installation profile and all necessary pieces. If you want to download the install-ready codebase to play around with, use this one.
